## by (Oni Samuel Oluwapelumi)


## Dataset

>Prosper Loan dataset contains information of 113937 loan listings and 81 varaibles. The 81 varaibles are categories conatianing detailed information relating to prosper loan. The link to this dataset was provided and was downloaded manually from the Udacity classroom.
Some major variables are:
Loan Status - Indicating the status of the loan. If it's cancelled, completed, defaulted or past due date.
Listing Category - The reason the borrower took the loan i.e Auto, Engagement rings, Wedding loans e.t.c
Occupation - This contains the occupation of the borrower.
BorrowerState- This indicates the borrowers's state 


## Summary of Findings

>For my Exploratory analysis, I ploted 11  Univariate, 3 Bivariate and 2 Multivariate. My main feature of interest was to explore the loan amount, to see how other variables relate with it and to find out factors that affect the loan amounts given out.

>During my exploration, It can be observed that majority of people took out loan to pay back debt. I also discovered that there was a correlation between the borrower's income and the loan amount given. It is also encouraging in a little way that the percentage of people who had payed back the loan is almost thrice the people that defaulted and few people are past their due date.

>Also People in California tend took more loans,followed by Professionals and Computer Programmers than people from other occupations. 3 years was also the most popular loan term.



## Key Insights for Presentation

>For my insights, I will focus on two Univariate and one Bivariate visualisation. The first visualisation depicts the top 10 states that took the most loan, with California topping the chart followed by Texas.

>The second visualisation is a Bivariate plot that depicts the relationship between loan amount and income range.It can be observed from the boxplot that there is a slight correlation. People who earn $100k had the oppoutunity to take larger loans compared to the rest. The only outlier is people that earn $25k+
>Lastly, we have a Univariate visualisation which is used to show the employment status of the borrowers.It's discovered that people that are employed took the most loan and part-time, Not-employed and Retired rarely took.
